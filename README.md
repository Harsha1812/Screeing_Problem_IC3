Hello there !

I have assumed that the input string is a fixed and built up the solution accordingly. However, for testing for different scenarios, I have added test cases using JUnit framework.

Please be noted that in order to execute this program, the required software is java8 and eclipse ide ().

After cloning the source code in to the eclipse, please run the Main class file "ScreeningStarter.java" to see the required report for the given input string.

Also, to excute the test cases(ProcessorTest.java and UtilityTest.java), please run the each test case class file to execute all the respective test cases at one go.

I have added the problem statement and some screen shots that executed in my local in the resources folder just for quick reference.
